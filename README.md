### Dataset - Global data on sustainable energy with 3650 rows covering the 21 years years from 2000 to 2020.
### Data cleaning and analysis - Pandas and Numpy 
### Data Visualization - Seaborn and Matplotlib
### The following insights were drawn from the analysis:


1. World average access to electricty grew from 72.3% in 2000 to 85.5% in 2020

2. Majority of the world has 100% electricity access but they are mostly first world countries.
Between 2000 and 2020, Guinea-Bissau, Somalia, Afghanistan, Somalia, Lesotho, Solomon Islands all moved out of the list of 10 countries with least access to electricity

3. South Sudan, Burkina Faso, Niger, Sierra Leone and Mozambique replaced them.

4. Afghanistan and Solomon Islands made the highest jumps on the rankings. Afghanistan moved from 171 in electricity access ranking in 2000 to 110 in 2020 with 97.7 of its population having access to elcetricity in 2020. That's a far cry of 1.61 percent asccess in 2000.

5. Solomon Islands moved from 165 with electricty access of 4.52% percent in 2000 to 132 in 2020 with 73.35% of its population having access to electricity.

6. All the countries with the least mean access to electricity from 2000 to 2020 are in Africa

7. Comparing renewable Energy Share and CO2 Emissions per Capita reveals a negative correlation as confirmed by the chart. It shows that as countries adopt renewable energy, they rely less on fossils which in turn results in a drop in their carbon emissions.

8. World renewable electricity generating capacity per capita increased between 2000 and 2020 from 67 to 126 TWh

9. Between 2000 and 2020, electricity generation from fossil fuels increased from 49 to 82 TWh with a slight drop in 2019 and 2020, reaching a record 85 Twh in 2018.

11. China, the United States and India still generate the highest energy from fossils.
